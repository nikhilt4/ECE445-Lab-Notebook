Hello Notebook!

1. First meeting: 9/5
   - initial brainstorming on the idea.
   - suggestetd high-level systems and subsystems to see interests and expertise
   - plan initial design ideas (heaadband-ish cap, pcb, electrodes wired neatly around cap)
   - Idea post made by Nikhil
  
2. Second meeting: 9/9
   - Since no replies to idea post, met with indian prof, and asked for opinion
   - Prof feedback was studied and taken into account
       - false-negative and false-positive rates
       - comparison with modern sleep-detecting methods(cameras in cars etc)
       - seemlessness of design
       - sleep detection algorithm 
   - prof feedback was studied and included in rfa draft
   - posted RFA
  
3. 3rd meeting: 9/14
   - proposal planning and discussion
   - drafted proposal
   - finalised high-level block diagram and subsystems as given below:

   - looked through online for components and prices estimate:

4. Meeting TA 9/16
   - Work on subsystem requirements, almost same as system requirement, but be more specific with the components
   - Can use the ADS1229 chip instead since we are still wiring it and its only a chip and not a whole on-board chip.
   - Work on proposal, seem like we are on the right road.
  
5. 4th meeting: 9/19
   - Prepared Proposal together with Nikhil.
   - Worked on the overleaf formatting, and design for power, signal acquisition, and alarm systems.
   - Understand complexities of power system such as battery ratings for enough battery life; battery size; battery safety management and buck converter.
   - Made more detailed block diagram with components and power ratings for easier power system design
