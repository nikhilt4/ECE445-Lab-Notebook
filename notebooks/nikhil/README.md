**14th September 2025**

Objectives:
- Discuss sections of the proposal and project
- Find parts for our product online (ADC, Electrodes, Micro Controllers)
- Complete the BLock Diagram

We figured out and labelled parts we need for or project. We decided on two methods we can take when building the Analog signal processing subsystem. Will discuss further with our TA on 9/16 of requirements and rules to decide which method we should use.
Finished the rough block diagram. Need to complete the Connections of subsystems and clean up the formatting ofr 9/16 TA meeting.

**17th September 2025**

**Individual Work**

Objectives:
- Write up the team contract and send to Senny
- Start on the proposal (Introduction, High level requirements, Ethics and Safety)

Finished the team contract by answering the questions. Sent to Senny and asked him to add some project goals and edit any components he sees fit. Once done, ready for signature and submission
Organized parts of our proposal document. Some components were already written or completed such as the introduction, block diagram and high-level requirements. Started on the ethics and safety section. Used the IEEE code of Ethics to see how our product aligns with these guidelines and what we can do in the future.




**19th September**

Objectives:
- Finsih the project proposal
    - Ethics and Safety, Problem, Solution and Design sections
    - Visual Representation

We worked on the project proposal and finished the final parts. Used the IEEE and ACM code of ethics to outline ethical guidelines related with our product. Created a rough representation of how our product looks and works. Shown Below:

**21th September**

**Individual Work**

Objectives:
- Prepare for proposal review

Made notes on specific parts of proposal for our review on the 22nd. Used ChatGPT to think of some sample questions I can work on to prepare.


**22nd September**


**Proposal Review**




**3rd October**
Objectives:
- Order Parts

We ordered all our parts.




**6th October**
Objectives:
- Refine circuit schematics
- Build schematics on breadboard for demo
- Simple coding and intro to nucleo board

We received the parts we ordered on friday such as the buzzers, battery, and nucleo dev board.
We built circuits for the breadboard demo such as an LDO, analog electrode filter and simple buzzer circuits for our dev board.





**12th October**
**Individual Work**
Objectives:
- Build stm32f412rgt6 circuit schematic on KiCad

Built the STM circuit with power, decoupling circuits, NRST reset push button, and fixing connections to and from the ADS1299.



**13th October**
Objectives:
- Design Document

Finished the design document with Senny. Wrote the Cost, schedule, alarm and controller system sections. 
Discussed our next steps for the PCB and started research on that for the Second Pass.



**16th October**
Objectives:
- Finish the PCB design for the Second Pass

Finished the PCB for the Second Pass deadline.
PCB schematics and image shown in the diagrams seciton.


**17th October**
**Individual Work**
Objectives:
- Visit the machine shop for a discussion on our project assembly.**

Visited the machine shop and spoke to one of the technicians about our project. Discussed the mountin gsystem above our hat for the PCB and battery, electrode bolts, wiring, weight and overall user experience. 

**25th October**
Objectives:
- Work on the breadboard demo 2
- Testing of electrode channels using STM Nucleo board ADC
- Early firmware of STM for understanding digital signal processing, testing GPIO logic of buzzer,etc

Built our breadboard for demo to Professor and TA. Assembled an EEG signal pipeline with electrodes, stm nucleo board and a python script which does FFT and furhter analysis to display signals

**30th October**
Objectives:
- Work on ordering parts for the pcb and finalizing our parts excel

Bill of material excel sheet finalized, parts ordered from digikey and other websites.

**2nd November**
Objectives:
- Refine pcb for second order

Adjusted our PCB and fixed footprints and other errors for order

**17th November**
Objectives:
- Assemble parts on boards
- Testing for seperate subsystems and other to test

Received our final parts from Digikey to start fabricating, assembling and testing.
Used our previous PCB boards for smaller subsystems to test and verify signals (controller and ADS1299 electrode sammples)

**28th November**
Objectives:
- Finalize PCB assembly
- Testing firmware and functionality with on board STM chip

Assembled our stm and ads1299 chips on the PCB board and started testing on board firmware without the Nucleo.
Tested signals and wrote STM firmware for that.
Refined sample output from the ADS1299

**1st December**
Objectives:
- Finalize design for demo
Finalize design, assemly of the cap and full overview for the demo.

**7th December**
Objectives:
- User trials and tests
- Interpretation of results and plots

Testing on other subjects to see drowsiness detection and its accuracy. 
Data collected from these users was collated, analyzed and plotted using python scripts.
